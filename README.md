💡 This was one of my first personal projects since I began studying HTML & CSS on my own, and last, before the current one, of my final project ideas for the Coderhouse's Web Development course. It's a redesign of Blizzard's famous game launcher, Battle.net.

👉 It has the following characteristics:\
1️⃣ 5 sections.\
2️⃣ Layout → Grid.\
3️⃣ Components → Flexbox & Bootstrap.\
4️⃣ Responsive.
